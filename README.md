# Pericardial-adipose-tissue
This is the repository of codes used for the article addressing the role of pericardial adipose tissue in obesity-related heart disease. This repository contains the codes and proteomic data used in the article.
This repository contains one script for each analysis performed with the proteomic data. The name of the script is linked to the name of the excel file, therefore, there will be one R code for each excel file.
This approach is useful because human and mouse samples comparing different adipose tissue depots are paired, while when comparing lean vs. obese (both humans and mouse) the samples are not paired.
